# CardGameTutorial
A self contained, self guided tutorial to make a simple card game

##To Start
* Download the files and open in your favorite Java IDE (I used Eclipse).
* You won't be able to run the project, since the methods are incomplete (You have to fill them in!).
* The project is extensively commented in order to help you fill in the methods and create a working game
* I recommend completing the Card class first, then the Deck class, and then filling in Main. (The player class is done)
